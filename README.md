# GIPF Board Game Recreation

## Project Description

This project is a recreation of a portion of the classic abstract strategy board game *GIPF*, designed by Kris Burm. The game is part of the GIPF Project series, a collection of six games that revolve around strategic and combinatorial play. This project focuses on capturing the core mechanics of GIPF, including piece placement, movement, and strategic decision-making.

The goal is to provide an interactive, digital version of the game where players can experience the essence of GIPF, testing their skills against either a computer opponent or another player.

## Features

- **Turn-based gameplay**: Players alternate in placing or moving pieces on a hexagonal board.
- **Push mechanic**: Implement the signature GIPF mechanic where pieces can be pushed off the board.
- **Piece elimination**: Capture pieces by pushing them off the edge of the board or into specific positions.
